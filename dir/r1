Development
In May 2021, the makers of the film Pushpa announced that the film would be released in two parts, with the second installment coming out in 2022.[10] About 10% of the shooting had already been completed before the release of the first part. However, due to the success of the film KGF: Chapter 2, there were rumours that it had the same storyline as Pushpa 2: The Rule. Therefore, director Sukumar decided to rewrite and reshoot the entire second part to make sure that the audience gets a unique experience. Sukumar confirmed that the stories were not the same, but he wanted to fulfill the audience's anticipation and correct previous mistakes.[11]

At the end of the first part of the film, the title was revealed to be Pushpa 2: The Rule. The second part of the film was officially launched with a traditional pooja ceremony in Hyderabad in August 2022.[12]

Filming
Even though a few scenes of Pushpa 2 were already filmed prior to the release of the first part, Sukumar stated that he altered the story a bit and that he was going to reshoot the entire film.[13] Principal photography for the film is scheduled to commence in October 2022.[14]

Release
The film will release in theatres on 15 August 2024, coinciding Indian Independence Day, in Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam languages.[15]
