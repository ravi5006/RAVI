Development
The film along with its title was announced on 2 December 2020.[10] Touted to be an action thriller, the film marks the first collaboration between director Prashanth Neel and Prabhas, and the first Telugu venture of Neel. On his role, Prabhas stated: "My character is extremely violent, so this is something I haven’t really done before."[11] A few reports claimed that the film is a remake of Neel's debut film Ugramm, however, Neel clarified that Salaar is not a remake but an original story written for Prabhas.[12]

The film was formally launched in Hyderabad on 16 January 2021.[13] Ravi Basrur is composing the music while Bhuvan Gowda is the cinematographer.[14]

Casting
Actress Shruti Haasan was cast in a leading role in January 2021.[14] Kannada actor Madhu Guruswamy is set to play a pivotal role.[15] In March, actress Easwari Rao was signed to play Prabhas' mother.[16] Later in August, Jagapathi Babu joined the cast, whose character was revealed as Rajamanaar.[17]

In October 2021, Malayalam actor Prithviraj Sukumaran entered talks to play a crucial role in the film.[18] In March 2022, Prabhas said that Prithviraj is part of Salaar during a promotional event for his film Radhe Shyam.[19][20] Later in June, Prithviraj stated that he gave a nod to the script but was trying to adjust the dates to work in the film.[21] Later in October 2022, Prithiviraj's role was confirmed and the film marks his return to Telugu cinema after 12 years, following his appearance in Police Police (2010).[22] Sriya Reddy is also cast in a key role.[23]

Filming
The film's shoot began on 29 January 2021 in the coal mines near the city of Godavarikhani, Telangana.[24] First schedule was completed by February 2021.[25] Second schedule of the film began in August 2021 in Hyderabad.[26][27]

About 30% of the shoot was completed by March 2022. Filming was halted due to the release of Prabhas' Radhe Shyam (2022) and Neel's K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022) and was planned to be resumed in May.[28] However, Prabhas underwent a knee fracture in March during his vacation in Spain, which further delayed the shoot.[29][30] In June 2022, a new schedule began at Hyderabad's Ramoji Film City with Prabhas and Haasan joining the sets.[31] The team also shot a 20-minute long action sequence in the middle of the sea, spending about ₹10 crore on the scene.[32]

Makers of Salaar reportedly employed Dark Centric Theme (DCT) technology to shoot the film, making it the first Indian film to do so. As a result the film's lighting pattern and color palette would be darker in color.[33]
